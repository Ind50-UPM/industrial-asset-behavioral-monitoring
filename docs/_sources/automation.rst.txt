Automation and Batch Runs
=========================

The repository includes dedicated batch utilities to process month-wise parquet
campaigns without forcing monolithic runs over the full historical archive.

Batch Artefacts
---------------

- Monthly outputs preserve partial progress and simplify restart after interruptions.
- Manifest files expose which months were processed, empty, reused, or failed.
- Consolidated outputs provide the flat files consumed by downstream models and reporting layers.
